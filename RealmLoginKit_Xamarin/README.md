Realm LoginKit is a UI framework that provides a fully featured login screen for apps that make use of the Realm Mobile Platform.

It has been designed to be easily dropped into existing app codebases, and to provide a fully featured interface allowing users to either log in, or register new accounts in that app.

# Features
* Light & dark themes for light apps like Realm Draw, and dark apps like Realm Tasks.
* Fully adaptive to both smartphone, and tablet screen sizes.
* Easy swapping between 'log in' and 'sign up' modes.
* Optional settings to hide the server URL and 'remember me' form fields.
* The ability to remember username and passwords on subsequent app launches.
