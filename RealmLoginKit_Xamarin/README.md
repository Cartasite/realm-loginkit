# Realm LoginKit for Xamarin
> A general purpose account login user interface for apps implementing the Realm Mobile Platform.

## TODO

* once have network, cleanup by branching again from master and merging in this code, as due to absence of .gitignore, added tons of stuff should have excluded
* replace Readme image with images from Xamarin version
* review README against my goals of features
* copy feature list here from Evernote from Mac
* for example maybe use XS on Mac to create simple navigation path invoking loginkit - decide on how to invoke within a UI as modal? Should modality be part of the kit and how can users customise.
* for now can have the example just invoke the loginpage

Realm LoginKit is a UI framework that provides a fully featured login screen for apps that make use of the Realm Mobile Platform.

It has been designed to be easily dropped into existing app codebases, and to provide a fully featured interface allowing users to either log in, or register new accounts in that app.

# Features
* Light & dark themes for light apps like Realm Draw, and dark apps like Realm Tasks.
* Fully adaptive to both smartphone, and tablet screen sizes.
* Easy swapping between 'log in' and 'sign up' modes.
* Optional settings to hide the server URL and 'remember me' form fields.
* The ability to remember username and passwords on subsequent app launches.
