# Realm LoginKit

Realm LoginKit is a UI framework that provides a fully featured login screen for apps that make use of the Realm Mobile Platform.

It has been designed to be easily dropped into existing app codebases, and to provide a fully featured interface allowing users to either log in, or register new accounts in that app.

# Features
* Fully adaptive to both smartphone, and tablet screen sizes.
* Able to transition between 'log in' and 'sign up' modes.
* Options to hide the server URL and 'remember me' form fields if desired.
* The ability to remember username and passwords on subsequent app launches.

# Versions

Realm LoginKit only supports iOS at the moment. An Android version is currently in development, and a Xamarin version is on the roadmap.

Please navigate to the root directory of each version for code samples and installation instructions.

* [iOS Version](https://github.com/realm-demos/realm-loginkit/tree/master/RealmLoginKit%20Apple/) - Written in Swift, but also fully Objective-C compatible.
